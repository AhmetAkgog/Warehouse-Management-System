# Warehouse-Management-System
Stock control system for a business with five different warehouses. I used Python, MySQL, MySQL connector,openpyxl for Excel transfers, and pyqt5 for the GUI.

Main.py: This file can download the whole database or stock transfers between warehouses on a specific date.

Stockmovementtab.py: This file responsible for stock movements, The user chooses a warehouse and uploads a transfer excel file for the appropriate warehouse. In case of wrong uploads user can revert the database based on timestamps.
